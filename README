NAME
       paddle - log processor to send logs from logdirs to TCP syslog

SYNOPSIS
       paddle [-p] [host:port]

DESCRIPTION
       paddle reads log lines on standard input and sends them as RFC5424
       syslog messages to host:port (or "localhost:514" by default) using TCP
       with RFC6587 octet counting as a frame format.

       (This format is understood by VictoriaLogs.)

       The following log formats are supported:

       svlog -t
           Hexadecimal TAI timestamps.  Caveat: no leap second adjustment is
           performed.

       svlog -tt, svlog -ttt, s6-log T
           ISO8601 timestamps with "T", "_" or " " separator between date and
           time.  The subsecond part is normalized to six digits.  Timestamps
           need to be UTC.

OPTIONS
       -p  Enable useful behavior as a log processor for svlogd or s6-log.

           In case of a connection or transmission error, standard input is
           copied to standard error, which will result in reprocessing the
           logs on the next execution.  (paddle needs to be run from tryto(1)
           to make this work.)

EXIT STATUS
       The paddle utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

       When -p is used, paddle always exits with status 0 unless the command
       line is invalid.

EXAMPLES
       A svlogd(1) config file to ship logs every 60 seconds to a local
       VictoriaLogs instance listening on port 1514:

           s1048576
           t60
           n10
           !tryto -p -t10 paddle -p localhost:1514
